# Cryptocurrency-analysis

◢ Introduction: 

Today, there are different type of cryptocurrencies with different technologies and 
functionality. Since their inception in 2008 and the subsequent enthusiasm, media 
attention, delusion, reflection, and continuous innovation, ‘cryptocurrencies’ have 
become one of the most interesting and perhaps most misunderstood phenomena of the 
early 21st century. Since the inception of cryptocurrencies, an increasing number of 
financial institutions are getting involved in cryptocurrency trading. It is therefore 
important to summarise existing research papers and results on cryptocurrency trading. 
This paper provides a comprehensive survey of cryptocurrency trading research, by 
covering cryptocurrency trading systems, bubble and extreme condition, prediction of 
volatility and return, crypto-assets portfolio construction and crypto-assets, technical 
trading and others.

Cryptocurrency analysis and predictions have been sought after due to the increasing 
values of these crypto-coins since their inception. Cryptocurrency prediction and price 
analysis has emerged one of the popular trends in the prognostication domain. 
Prediction of future prices of cryptocurrencies using past data is possible with the help 
of statistical tools and techniques.

◢ Cryptocurrency – meaning and definition:

Cryptocurrency, generally referred to as cryptocurrency or crypto, may be any sort of 
currency that exists digitally or nearly and uses cryptography to secure transactions. 
Cryptocurrencies don't have a central issuance or regulation authority, rather than 
employing a suburbanized system to record transactions and issue new units.

1. Bitcoin (BTC) - Created in 2009 by someone under the pseudonym Satoshi 
Nakamoto, Bitcoin (BTC) is the original cryptocurrency. As with most 
cryptocurrencies, BTC runs on a blockchain, or a ledger logging transaction
distributed across a network of thousands of computers. Because additions to 
the distributed ledgers must be verified by solving a cryptographic puzzle, a 
process called proof of work, Bitcoin is kept secure and safe from fraudsters.

2. Ethereum (ETH) - Both a cryptocurrency and a blockchain platform, 
Ethereum is a favourite of program developers because of its potential 
applications, like so-called smart contracts that automatically execute when 
conditions are met and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

3. Binance Coin (BNB) - The Binance Coin is a form of cryptocurrency that you 
can use to trade and pay fees on Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges in 
the world.

4. Tether (USDT) - Unlike some other forms of cryptocurrency, Tether is a stable 
coin, meaning it’s backed by fiat currencies like U.S. dollars and the Euro and 
hypothetically keeps a value equal to one of those denominations. In theory, this 
means Tether’s value is supposed to be more consistent than other 
cryptocurrencies, and it’s favoured by investors who are wary of the extreme a
volatility of other coins.

5. Ripple (XRP) - Created by Ripple Labs Inc., a US-based technology company. 
Released in 2012, a digital technology and payment processing company, XRP 
can be used on that network to facilitate exchanges of different currency types, 
including fiat currencies and other major cryptocurrencies.

◢ ANALYSIS AND INFERENCE: 

#### (1) Exploratory Data analysis entails the exploration of different price distributions to 
#### analyse any trends and seasonality. A Price distribution chart gives a glimpse of how 
#### the prices have been thought for the past 5 years for all cryptocurrencies.

#### (2) However, correlation coefficients are very handy in terms of understanding the 
#### relationships between different currencies. All cryptocurrencies were more or 
#### less correlated with each other positively or negatively.

#### (3) Volume is such an important metric when analysing cryptos and it can help 
#### investors in showing a coin’s direction. A greater volume of cryptocurrency 
#### transactions leads to fair cryptocurrency prices and removes the chance of 
#### distorted pricing.

#### (4) Bitcoin is leading the market. Bitcoin is probably the best-known 
#### cryptocurrency, and its value has been skyrocketed in recent years. Ethereum is 
#### another popular cryptocurrency worth looking into, as its value has been 
####steadily increasing over the past.
